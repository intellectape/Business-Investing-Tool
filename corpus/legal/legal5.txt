Public resources: electric vehicle chargingstations.   Existing law establishes the Alternative and Renewable Fuel andVehicle Technology Program, administered by the State EnergyResources Conservation and Development Commission, which authorizes,among other things, upon appropriation by the Legislature, a grantprogram to provide funding for homeowners who purchase a plug-inelectric vehicle to offset costs associated with modifying electricalsources that include a residential plug-in electric vehicle chargingstation.   Existing law also creates a grant program for the purchase andlease of zero-emission vehicles, as defined, in the state to bedeveloped and administered by the State Air Resources Board inconjunction with the commission. The program provides grants tospecified recipients in an amount equal to 90% of the incrementalcost above $1,000 of an eligible new zero-emission light-duty car ortruck, as defined.   This bill would create the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations OpenAccess Act, which would prohibit the charging of a subscription feeon persons desiring to use an electric vehicle charging station, asdefined, and would prohibit a requirement for persons to obtainmembership in any club, association, or organization as a conditionof using the station, except as specified. The bill would require thetotal actual charges for the use of an electric vehicle chargingstation to be disclosed to the public at the point of sale. The billwould require an electric vehicle charging station to provide to thegeneral public 2 specified options of payment.    This bill would require the service provider of electric vehicleservice equipment, as defined, at an electric vehicle chargingstation, as defined, to disclose to the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory the charging station's geographic location, a schedule offees, accepted methods of payment, and the amount of network roamingcharges for nonmembers, if any.   This bill, if no interoperability billing standards have beenadopted by a national standards organization by January 1, 2015,would authorize the state board to adopt interoperability billingstandards, as defined, for network roaming payment methods forelectric vehicle charging stations, and would require, if the stateboard adopts standards, all electric vehicle charging stations thatrequire payment to meet those standards within one year.THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:  SECTION 1.  The Legislature finds and declares all of thefollowing:   (a) California is the nation's largest market for cars andlight-duty trucks.   (b) The transportation sector is the biggest contributor toCalifornia's greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for approximately40 percent of these emissions.   (c) California should encourage the development and success ofzero-emission vehicles to protect the environment, stimulate economicgrowth, and improve the quality of life in the state.   (d) California should encourage and support the development ofinfrastructure for open and accessible public charging stations.   (e) In order to reach the goal of 1.5 million electric drivevehicles in California by 2025, electric vehicle (EV) consumers needconfidence that they can access a robust network of publiclyavailable EV charging stations. Any EV driver should be able toaccess any publicly available EV charging station, regardless of thesystem provider.   (f) EV consumers and drivers need to be able to find the stationsand know how much they cost.   (g) It is the intent of the Legislature to (1) promote a positivedriving experience by assisting in the widespread deployment ofelectric vehicles, (2) not limit the ability of a property owner orlessee of publicly available parking spaces, as defined in Section44268, to restrict use of or access to those parking spaces to itscustomers, and (3) facilitate expanded EV driver access to electricvehicle charging stations in public places.  SEC. 2.  Chapter 8.7 (commencing with Section 44268) is added toPart 5 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:      CHAPTER 8.7.  ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS OPEN ACCESSACT   44268.  As used in this chapter, the following terms have thefollowing meanings:   (a) "Battery" means an electrochemical energy storage systempowered directly by electrical current.   (b) "Electric vehicle" means a vehicle that uses a plug-in batteryto provide all or part of the motive power of the vehicle, includingbattery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or plug-in fuel cellvehicle.   (c) "Electric vehicle charging station" means one or more publiclyavailable parking spaces served by electric vehicle serviceequipment.   (d) "Electric vehicle service equipment" means an electriccomponent assembly or cluster of component assemblies designedspecifically to charge batteries within electric vehicles bypermitting the transfer of electric energy to a battery or otherstorage device in an electric vehicle.   (e) "Interoperability billing standards" means the ability for amember of one electric charging station billing network to useanother billing network.   (f) "Network roaming" means the act of a member of one electricvehicle charging station billing network using a charging stationthat is outside of the member's billing network with his or herbilling network account information.   (g) "Publicly available parking space" means a parking space thathas been designated by a property owner or lessee to be available to,and accessible by, the public and may include on-street parkingspaces and parking spaces in surface lots or parking garages."Publicly available parking space" shall not include a parking spacethat is part of, or associated with, a private residence, a parkingspace that is reserved for the exclusive use of an individual driveror vehicle or for a group of drivers or vehicles, such as employees,tenants, visitors, residents of a common interest development, orresidents of an adjacent building, or a parking space provided by aproducer of electric vehicles as a service. Nothing in this articlelimits the ability of an owner or lessee of a publicly availableparking space whose primary business is other than electric vehiclecharging from restricting use of the parking space, such as limitinguse to customers and visitors of the business.   44268.2.  (a) (1) Persons desiring to use an electric vehiclecharging station that requires payment of a fee shall not be requiredto pay a subscription fee in order to use the station, and shall notbe required to obtain membership in any club, association, ororganization as a condition of using the station. The total actualcharges for the use of an electric vehicle charging station,including any additional network roaming charges for nonmembers,shall be disclosed to the public at the point of sale. An electricvehicle charging station that requires payment of a fee shall allow aperson desiring to use the station to pay via credit card or mobiletechnology, or both.   (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an electric vehicle chargingstation may offer services on a subscription- or membership-onlybasis provided those electric vehicle charging stations allownonsubscribers or nonmembers the ability to use the electric vehiclecharging station through the payment options detailed in paragraph(1).   (b) The service provider of electric vehicle service equipment atan electric vehicle charging station or its designee shall discloseto the National Renewable Energy Laboratory the electric vehiclecharging station's geographic location, a schedule of fees , acceptedmethods of payment, and the amount of network roaming charges fornonmembers, if any.   (c) Electric vehicle charging stations shall be labeled inaccordance with Part 309 of Title 16 of the Code of FederalRegulations, and, where commercially reasonable and feasible, may beclearly marked with appropriate directional signage in the parkingarea or facility where they are located.   (d) If no interoperability billing standards have been adopted bya national standards organization by January 1, 2015, the state boardmay adopt interoperability billing standards for network roamingpayment methods for electric vehicle charging stations. If the stateboard adopts interoperability billing standards, all electric vehiclecharging stations that require payment shall meet those standardswithin one year. Any standards adopted by the state board shallconsider other governmental or industry-developed interoperabilitybilling standards and may adopt interoperability billing standardspromulgated by an outside authoritative body.For information please visit: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/   LOAD-DATE: October 2, 2013LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewswireCopyright 2013 Plus Media Solutions Private LimitedAll Rights Reserved
